Thanks to:
 - Cesar Hernandez (ZEsarUX coder) - For his help along the emulator development. 
   Thanks also, because the source code of his emulator (ZEsarUX) was a very good reference in many occasions.
- Jos√© Luis Sanchez (JSpeccy coder) - For his help in the AY emulator matters. I take his Java code as reference in this matter.
